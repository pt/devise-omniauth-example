The "lived in" version:

- allows creation of account with no password via omniauth providers
- stores provider auth tokens for future use
- populates name and email from data from providers if blank
- adds photos, extracted from auth'd account(s)
- allows posting to fb and twitter using tokens
- user settable slugs & vanity URLs
- css reset
- profile pages
- added nil user object
- adds friendly display_name to user

FAQ
- I Get an error "REQUEST URI too large" when trying to authenticate with google open id
-- To fix this, (when using webrick), you need to increase the maximm length. In my case, I changed the file

/Users/abe/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p290/lib/ruby/1.9.1/webrick/httprequest.rb

On line 246 from:

      @request_line = read_line(socket, 1024) if socket
      if @request_line.bytesize >= 1024 and @request_line[-1, 1] != LF

to:

      @request_line = read_line(socket, 2048) if socket
      if @request_line.bytesize >= 2048 and @request_line[-1, 1] != LF

== Rails3 Omniauth-Devise supercombo

As bare as you could get devise-omniauth combo

I wasn't sure why all the provider callbacks were separated as they can all be handled in the same fashion.

The Wiki also didn't mention how we should be keeping track of the user tokens in the case we want to allow the user to validate multiple providers.

So I created a basic model storing the user_id, provider, & uid.
